                GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
                WHEN I load their portfolio
                THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
                THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
                THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
                THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEN I click on the images of the applications
                THEN I am taken to that deployed application
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
                THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
